# project_kickstarter_info
For this project, the costumer wants a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever". 

Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign data are analyzed to determine specific factors that affect a project campaing's success.

First, by using conditional formatting, some of the columns of the worksheet are highlighted (etc. outcomes). 

Because the customer is interested in theater/play in the US, by sorting our data, two different worksheets are prepared to show Successful and Failed campaigns in the US.(Successful US Kickstarter and Failed US Kickstarter)

To determine how a campaign achieves its funding goal, percentages of campaing funding are calculated. 

Since the customer wants to start a campaign for theather, the data is sorted to Category and Subcategory, and analyzed. For this analysis visual presentations are added (Parent Category Outcomes and Parent Subcategory Outcomes).

To determine the campaign timeline, Outcomes Based on Launch Date worksheet is created and Kickstarter campaigns outcomes are analyzed based on months (Unix timestamps). A line chart is added for visual presentation.

In the Descriptive Statistic worksheet, based on Successful US Kickstarter and Failed US Kickstarter, our data's Mean, Median, Standart Deviation, and IQR are calculated. 

For the customer's future project research for musicals in Great Britain, a BoxPlot is created by using the distribution of campaign goals and the total amount of pledge. The extreme data points(outliers) were eliminated to plan better campaign funding(Customer estimate budget £4000).

## Regarding Our Findings
Examining our "Parent Category Outcomes" bar chart; It indicates that among all the other subcategories, theather has the highest success. 

Examining our "Outcomes Based On Launch Date" line chart; It reveals that May and June are the best time of the year to launch a campaign. Additionally, many failed campaings launched in January, June, July and October.    

Examining our BoxPlot chart for researching musicals in GB; It shows that the campaign goal(£4000)is outside of the pledge IRQ. That means the customer should reduce the production cost of the musical (Probably around or under £2000- Because of the goal-median).
